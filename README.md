# InternetBlocker
System tray application for enabling and disabling firewall rules. The "Block Internet In" and "Block Internet Out" rules must already be defined in windows firewall.

Distributed using pynsist

build with:
```
pyinsist installer.cfg
```

TODO:
- create firewall rules automatically with user defined local network
- switch from netsh to a less intrusive enable/disable mechanism (maybe registry)
